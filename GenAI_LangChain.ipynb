He had been exploring the mansion with his parents, Dr. Emma and Professor Ryan, just hours before. But in the chaos of their investigation, Jack had wandered off in search of a rare book in the library. Now, he was trapped, and his parents were nowhere to be found.\n",

            "Panic set in as Jack's footsteps echoed through the empty halls. He frantically rushed from room to room, calling out for his parents, but his voice was swallowed by the thick, dusty air. The manor seemed to be shifting and twisting around him, making it impossible to keep track of which direction he had come from.\n",

            "As the darkness deepened, Jack began to feel a presence lurking just out of sight. He tried to shake off the feeling, telling himself it was just his imagination, but the hairs on the back of his neck refused to lie down. Suddenly, a chill ran down his spine as he heard the faint whisper of his mother's name: \"Emma... Emma...\"\n",

            "\n",
            "The whisper grew louder, more urgent, and Jack followed the sound to a door hidden behind a tattered tapestry. The door creaked open, revealing a narrow staircase that plunged into darkness. Jack hesitated, his gut screaming at him to turn back, but his fear for his parents propelled him forward.\n",
            "\n",
            "As he descended the stairs, the whispers grew clearer, and Jack recognized his father's voice: \"Ryan... Ryan, where are you?\" The words sent a shiver down his spine, and he stumbled forward, his hands outstretched to feel his way through the darkness.\n",
            "\n",

            "And then, he saw it: a figure, shrouded in shadows, standing at the bottom of the stairs. Jack's heart stopped as the figure began to move towards him, its presence filling the air with an unspeakable horror.\n",

            "In that moment, Jack knew he was not alone in Blackwood Manor. He was being hunted by something ancient, something malevolent, and something that would stop at nothing to claim him as its own.\n"
